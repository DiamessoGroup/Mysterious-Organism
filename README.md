# Mysterious Organism

## Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

## Project Goals

### Context:

You’re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.

As you progress through the steps, use the terminal and console.log() statements to check the output of your loops and functions.

#### Step 3

Since you need to create multiple objects, create a factory function pAequorFactory() that has two parameters:

The first parameter is number (no two organisms should have the same number).
The second parameter is an array of 15 DNA bases.
pAequorFactor() should return an object that contains the properties specimenNum and dna that correspond to the parameters provided.

You’ll also add more methods to this returned object in the later steps.
